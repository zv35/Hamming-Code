## About this project
This was originally intended to be used in a larger project as a part of an intership, however it stands as a self contained demo as well.
To see the demo simply run the python file:

```
python3 hamming.py
```

## About Hamming codes
A hamming code is a form of very simple error correction, it can only correct a few bits at a time but is very computationally and bandwidth freindly.
The process relies on several parity bits distributed throughout the data to "check" a section of the data.

[This  video explains Hamming codes much better than I could.](https://youtu.be/b3NxrZOu_CE)
